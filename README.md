## Hierarchical Reinforcement envs in pybullet

This package was created because all of the HRL locomotion envs are only available in mujoco. This is an implementation of as many as possible in pybullet. 

### Install
`pip install hrl_pybullet_envs`  
This project requires [pybullet-gym](https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym/) which must be installed separately.


### Envs:
* AntGatherBulletEnv-v0
* AntMazeBulletEnv-v0
